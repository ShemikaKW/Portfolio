                <p>I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m the oldest of 3 sisters. I have 4 nieces and 1 nephew. No kids of my own so I'm a part-time babysitter. 
                 I currently live in Decatur, Georgia. </p>
           
                <p> I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering technology from Fort Valley State University. I have taken several courses at APT College for data communications and networks. 
                    I have recently enrolled in a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp course at Georgia Tech.  I currently work at AT&T as a Wire Technician.
